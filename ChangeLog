libcec (1.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

   * changed/added:
     * added a firmware flash script for linux.
       usage: ./support/cec-flash-device.sh /path/to/firware.hex
     * refactored threading/locking - added windows native instead of
       pthread-win32, so we can compile native x64 too
     * check whether the adapter responds when connecting to it and report the
	   firmware version of the adapter after connecting
     * moved create-installer.cmd to support/
     * completely removed AM_SILENT_RULES
   * interface changes:
     * compile LibCecSharp against .NET framework 2.0 and sign the assembly

      clients as laggy keypresses
    * fixed reconnect after standby
    * wait for active tranmission to finish when opening a connection to the
      adapter. fixes initialisation errors

libcec (1.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

   * changed/added:
     * added the vendor id for Sony
     * always refresh the power state of a device when it hasn't been updated
       for 30 seconds
     * do silent builds by default
   * interface changes:
     * added optional callback methods to libCEC. enable them by calling
       EnableCallbacks(ICECCallbacks *callbacks) /
       cec_enable_callbacks(ICECCallbacks *callbacks). after this method is
       called, the GetNext...() methods will not return any data
     * added the same callbacks to LibCecSharp. implement CecCallbackMethods
       and override the methods in there
   * fixed:
     * use the given timeout when trying to open a connection to the CEC
       adapter
     * resolved difference between method name in LibCECC.cpp and cecc.h.

     * updated README. closes #14
     * added a script that tests some basic functions of the CEC adapter:

       don't send active source messages on startup, when not the active source
       fixes unwanted device power ups
     * replace the command handler directly after receiving a changed vendor
       id. change the primary type from recording device to playback device
       for panasonic TVs

       abort message
   * interface changes:
     * change the previously unused boolean parameter in volume control methods
       to bSendRelease, and only send a key release when it's true. default to
       true
   * fixed:
     * don't send the power up/down keypress to listeners when in the initial
       device state (powered off). fixes unexpected shutdown in XBMC when
       connecting to the CEC adapter.
     * send a 'menu state activated' command when starting up. bugzid: 113
     * don't wait for a response when not needed

libcec (1.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * changed/added:
    * make libudev optional. if libudev is not available on linux, adapter
      autodetection will also not be available. fixes compilation on Hardy/ATV1
    * added a C++ CLR wrapper for libCEC, so libCEC can be used by any .NET
      language
    * added vendor support for LG
    * added vendor support for Philips
    * added vendor support for Yamaha
    * added vendor support for Onkyo
    * added 'scan' command to cec-client, that displays info about devices on
      the bus. made all ToString() methods available on the interface.
    * added '-s' or '--single-command' to cec-client. starting cec-client with
      this parameter executes a single command in cec-client and does not power
      on devices on startup and power them off on exit. this way, you can use
      cec-client in a shell script. since there's some handshaking involved at
      startup, this is not very fast. to execute a command and only display the
      result and any error/warning, execute it with
      RESULT=`echo command | cec-client -s -d 3` (on linux/osx, win32 batch
      files are a bit different)
    * added HDMI port ('-p' or '--port') and base device ('-b' or '--base') to
      cec-client's parameters
    * handle image view on and text view on
    * handle routing information and report physical address opcodes
    * handle audio status updates
    * send ping and bootloader commands via the output queue
    * scan the CEC bus for devices when starting libcec
    * pass all commands that are directed at libcec to listeners
  * interface changes:
    * added GetActiveSource()/cec_get_active_source()
    * added IsActiveSource()/cec_is_active_source()
    * added GetDevicePhysicalAddress()/cec_get_device_physical_address()
    * added GetDeviceOSDName()/cec_get_osd_name()
    * added SendKeypress()/cec_send_keypress() and SendKeyRelease()/
      cec_send_key_release()
    * added VolumeUp()/cec_volume_up(), VolumeDown()/cec_volume_down(),
      MuteAudio()/cec_mute_audio()
    * added GetActiveDevices()/cec_get_active_devices(), IsActiveDevice()/
      cec_is_active_device(), IsActiveDeviceType()/cec_is_active_device_type().
    * added SetHDMIPort()/cec_set_hdmi_port(). devices are now detected on load
      and when a device with the same physical address is detected, libcec will
      use the selected hdmi port on that device. should fix source selection on
      other devices, like an amplifier
    * added a hook in libcec for physical address autodetection
  * fixed:
    * don't request the physical address from the tv (it's always 0x0000)
    * set the proper ackmask before doing anything else
    * don't unlock the transmit mutex in CCECProcessor while waiting for an
      answer
    * fix device polling
    * refactor CEC read/write. keep a single lock for all writes, not one per
      device
    * ignore other data while waiting for a response
    * retry failed tranmissions
    * don't delete a message before it's been sent when starting the bootloader
    * or when sending a ping
    * fixed possible segfault when switching the command handler after a vendor
    * id changed
    * handle audio opcodes correctly
    * inactive source should be directly addressed at the TV
    * don't report a changed physical address when it hasn't changed
    * routing information sets the stream path, not the physical address
    * don't scan the whole bus in CCECProcessor::IsActiveDeviceType()
    * don't request the vendor id from devices that are handled by libcec
    * mark device status as present when a command was received from a device
    * always send a power on command in CCECBusDevice::PowerOn()
    * don't request updates statusses unless needed
    * report physical address sends 3 parameters, not 2. check whether the
      device type is correct
    * devices can send vendor commands from other vendors, so don't assume the
      device is of a certain vendor when it sends commands with a vendor id
    * thread safety fixes. bugzid: 19
    * clear any previous input when opening a connection to the adapter.
      bugzid: 54
    * use the correct source address in CSLCommandHandler::HandleVendorCommand()
    * uncorrected CEC_OPCODE_DEVICE_VENDOR_ID. closes #5
    * renamed enum methods. fixes potential macro collision with isset().
      thanks davilla
    * don't change the active device when receiving stream path changed
      messages. fixes wrong source selection when powering after the TV.

    * audio systems cannot be an active source, so don't transmit active
      source message from this device
    * only send 'active source' when powered on

      others
    * increase physical address with 0x100 per device

  * added SetOSDString() to the interface (not supported by all tvs)
